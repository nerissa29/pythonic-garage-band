#### Setup
- .venv requirements
- connect local repo to GitHub
- install packages (such as git init, pytest, pip freeze, etc.)

##### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

- pytest-watch - runs tests
- python band.py - executes the code

##### How to use your library (where applicable)

##### Tests
- How do you run tests?
  - import pytest
  - from package_name.module_name import function_name
  - create tests to check if functions and all features are passing before finalizing the code.
  - pytest-watch on terminal (to run tests as you modify the code)
- Any tests of note?
  - attention to detail is critical, even small unexpected things can cause errors
- Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc
  - there are three tests left that I'm still working on
